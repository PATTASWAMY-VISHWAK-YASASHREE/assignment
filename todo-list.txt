Analysis phase:
- Understand requirements and core features for no-code ML pipeline builder (upload, preprocessing, split, model selection, execution, visualization).
- Identify backend architecture (FastAPI, service layer, pandas, scikit-learn) and frontend stack (React+Vite+TypeScript, MUI, React Flow, Zustand, Chart.js/Recharts).
- Consider edge cases: invalid files, non-numeric columns for scaling, missing target column, single-model constraint.

Research phase:
- Gather references for StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler usage from scikit-learn docs.
- Review best practices for FastAPI file uploads and React Flow pipeline UIs.

Implementation phase:
- Scaffold backend structure (main.py, routers, schemas, services).
- Implement dataset upload endpoint returning metadata and preview.
- Implement pipeline execution endpoint (preprocessing, split, model train/eval) with error handling.
- Add dependency files (requirements.txt) and configuration.
- Scaffold frontend with Vite + TS + MUI + React Flow + Zustand.
- Build UI components for each step, upload, preprocessing selection, split slider, model choice, run action, metrics/visualizations.
- Connect frontend to backend APIs with axios and environment config.
- Add visual pipeline/stepper showing flow and node status.

Testing phase:
- Manual sanity: run backend uvicorn and hit endpoints with sample CSV.
- Run frontend dev server and verify end-to-end flow.

Documentation phase:
- Write README with setup/run instructions for backend and frontend on Windows.
- Summarize architecture and endpoints.
