Analysis phase (CI/CD refresh):
- Confirm deployment target (GitHub Pages for frontend) and desired gates (tests/lint/build) before deploy.
- Identify repo structure: backend (FastAPI/Python) + frontend (Vite/React/TS).
- Determine runner OS (ubuntu-latest) and caching strategies for npm/pip.

Research phase (CI/CD patterns):
- Reference Vite GitHub Pages workflow with npm caching and actions/deploy-pages.
- Gather best practices for matrix tests, Pages permissions, concurrency, and artifact reuse.

Implementation phase:
- Add/adjust GitHub Actions workflows: one for CI (lint/tests/build) and one for Pages deploy using build artifact.
- Ensure frontend build uses correct base path and caches npm deps; ensure backend tests run with Python deps cache.
- Wire artifact handoff from build job to deploy job; set permissions and concurrency.

Testing phase:
- Run backend pytest locally or via workflow.
- Run frontend build in workflow.

Documentation phase:
- Update README with CI/CD workflow overview and how to trigger deploy/manual runs.

Current session tasks (CI/CD):
 [x] Capture web references for GH Pages CI/CD best practices.
 [x] Review existing workflows and repo config.
 [x] Draft updated CI/CD plan (jobs, caches, artifacts, triggers).
 [x] Implement workflow changes (ci.yml + improved deploy-pages.yml as needed).
 [x] Document and verify lint/tests/build expectations
